# Hollow Universe — The ground game

Status: draft 1, 12 October 2026. This is the Rust-style game on planet surfaces: what it is, how it's built and in
what order. [GAME_DESIGN.md](GAME_DESIGN.md) §5 says it in short; [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) holds the
engine-wide rules this follows (principles §2, determinism §8, networking §11, persistence §13).

Every rule is marked **Decided** (the owner said so), **Proposal** (waiting for a yes or no) or **Open**.

---

## 1. Decisions

| Topic | Rule | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Basis | Rust's ground loop, in first person: gather, craft, build, raid, full-loot PvP, sleepers, beds. | Decided |
| What may come from Rust | Its mechanics, its numbers (including the AK recoil pattern) and its UI design. | Decided |
| What may not | Asset files from Rust or any other game: models, textures, animations, sounds, maps, monuments. Not even as placeholders. The list of such files on this PC is in §9. | Decided |
| Names | Our own for items, devices and places. Plain words ("wooden door", "furnace") are fine. | Decided |
| Interface | The RustMVP interface, exactly (§8), built with `Ui` so it stays crisp at any resolution. | Decided |
| Multiplayer | Networked from the first line. Solo play runs the same server inside the game. | Decided |
| First world | A real planet from the generator: Nolcas Peris CQ-SLY 7-0 B 3 (§3). | Decided |
| It must look good | The surface (terrain, plants, water, sky) is part of G1 and is judged by the owner on screenshots. | Decided |
| Tech ladder | Rust's: rock, then stone tools, metal, firearms. Sci-fi only above that. | Proposal |
| Starter ship | The Tin Finch (`D:\GameDev\Assets\TinFinch_TF01`, our own Blender model): a single-seat skiff, crafted at the vehicle workbench. It is the first ship of the space part. | Decided |
| Day length | Planet rotation compressed 24 times for play: an Earth day becomes an hour, and the first world's day 87 minutes. Orbits and seasons stay real. Chosen by Claude while the owner is away; the owner may veto it. | Proposal |
| Who runs the work | Claude, on its own, until the whole thing is finished and polished; the owner is busy elsewhere and isn't asked to playtest in between. Progress is logged in `docs/progress-ground.md`. | Decided |
| Character | Our own character system (§4.8): a MakeHuman body (MPFB 2, CC0), Quaternius' Universal Animation Library 1 and 2 (CC0) retargeted onto it by script, clothing and armour modelled by our own Blender scripts. The owner approved the downloads on 12 October 2026. | Decided |

---

## 2. Lessons from earlier attempts

| Attempt | What went wrong | What this design does instead |
|---|---|---|
| hollow-orbit (browser, single player) | Game state, meshes and UI mixed in the same objects; random numbers and a variable time step everywhere; no network. | Rules in engine-free C#; fixed ticks; the server owns the state. |
| RustMVP, Godot phase (GDScript client, C++ server) | Every predicted rule written twice, in two languages. | One C# rules library used by the server, the client and the bots. |
| RustMVP, Unreal phase | One generic command call and whole-struct replication (an audit judged it wrong); the installed engine can't build a dedicated server. | Typed messages; per-client delta snapshots; the server is a plain .NET program. |

Their rules, numbers and edge cases are still the best reference we have (§6).

---

## 3. The first world

The first world is a real body of the generated universe, chosen from the planets the generator makes
(GALAXY.md §10.3). Within 400 ly of Sol there are 1,698 worlds with plants and animals; 71 have breathable air;
this is the one closest to an Earth-like place to live.

| | |
|---|---|
| System | Nolcas Peris CQ-SLY 7-0, 331.5 ly from Sol, 5.2 billion years old. `SystemAddress` `0x7810135EB5240000`. |
| Suns | B, an F9.5 V star (5,983 K, 1.46 × the Sun's light), which the planet orbits. A, a cool white dwarf about 486 AU from B. C, a hot white dwarf about 1,800 AU out. From the planet, A and C are the two brightest stars in the sky. |
| Planet | B 3, body path `0x20600000`. Earth-like world, radius 6,435 km, 0.92 g. |
| Orbit and day | 1.255 AU from B (93% of Earth's sunlight), a 489-day year, a 34.9-hour rotation, 23° tilt (seasons). |
| Climate | Mean 18 °C, 13–20 °C between night and day. |
| Air | 2.23 atm; oxygen 0.31 atm, CO₂ 0.08%: breathable. Thick air means a deep blue sky and hazy distances. |
| Surface | Oceans cover 45%, ice 8%. Moving plates (mountain ranges), gentle volcanism. Complex life: vegetation and animals. Hazards: quakes only. |
| Moon | B 3 a, rocky, 250 km radius, 32,036 km away, orbit 16.3 h. It looks about 1.7 times as wide as our Moon. |
| Neighbours | Two hot rocky planets inside, an asteroid belt and three ice giants with moons outside. |

- **Pinned by a test.** A golden test pins the planet's state. If a generator change alters it, the test fails and we
  decide what to do. The ground branch starts from `generator-v2` for this data.
- **The first zone** sits at a landing site chosen during the surface look-dev: a temperate coast with forest,
  hills and mountains in view.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Projects

```
src/Hollow.Core          (exists) double vectors, DMath, Hash64, Rng, units
src/Hollow.Galaxy        (exists) galaxy, star systems, planet state
src/Hollow.Surface       planet surfaces: height, climate, biomes, materials, scatter; chunk meshes and collision
src/Hollow.Simulation    entities, components, systems: movement, items, crafting, building, combat, survival
src/Hollow.Net           messages, bit packing, snapshots and deltas, transport (LiteNetLib)
src/Hollow.Client        the client without graphics: connection, prediction, interpolation, client world
src/Hollow.Persistence   SQLite storage
src/Hollow.Server        the dedicated server; also a library the game hosts in-process for solo play
game/                    Godot: views, first person, terrain rendering, UI, audio, input
game/data/ground/        items, recipes, building parts, loot, weapons, survival constants (JSON)
tools/Hollow.Bots        headless clients for tests and load tests
third_party/             vendored packages, so the repository builds without network access
```

Dependencies point one way: `Core ← Galaxy ← Surface ← Simulation ← Net ← Client / Server`, and
`Persistence ← Simulation`. The game references `Client` (and `Server`, for hosting). Nothing in `src/` references
Godot.

```
      both sides run the same rules and data: Hollow.Simulation + game/data/ground
┌─ Godot client ─────────────────┐         ┌─ Hollow.Server (.NET, no Godot) ────────┐
│ Hollow.Client (no Godot):      │   UDP   │ zones: physics (Jolt) + systems, 30 Hz  │
│   prediction, interpolation    │<------->│ replication: who sees what, snapshots   │
│ Godot: views, first person,    │         │ persistence: SQLite                     │
│   UI, audio, input             │         │ sessions, chat, raid alerts, admin      │
└────────────────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  bots = Hollow.Client without a window: 2 players + 100 bots, headless, in tests
```

### 4.2 Server

- One process. A **zone** is one surface region of one body: its entities, one Jolt physics world and the systems
  that run on them, at a fixed 30 ticks per second, on one thread at a time (ARCHITECTURE.md §10).
- **Tick order:** inputs → movement → actions (gather, build, craft, use) → projectiles and damage → survival →
  devices (furnaces, timers) → AI → decay and upkeep (slow) → replication. Dirty entities are saved every 30 s.
- **Static entities** (building parts, deployables, boxes) cost nothing per tick until something happens to them.
- **Natural things** (trees, ore, plants) come from the surface generator. Only changes are stored, such as "this tree
  is cut until T" (ARCHITECTURE.md P1).

### 4.3 Client

- **Hollow.Client** (no Godot) owns the connection and the client's copy of the world:
  - Input commands go out every tick.
  - The player's own character is predicted with Hollow.Simulation's movement code, against a local Jolt world
    built from the surface generator and the replicated static entities.
  - When a snapshot says "input 412 processed, you are here", the client rewinds and replays newer inputs.
  - Other entities are interpolated 100 ms behind the server.
  - Inventory and container contents are mirrored. Intents (build, craft, move an item) show at once in the UI
    and are confirmed or rejected by the server.
- **Godot** draws that world and nothing else: a surface mode with a floating origin, terrain from Hollow.Surface,
  entity views pooled by type, a first-person camera and viewmodel, third-person characters, UI and audio.
  Mouse look is applied every frame, never held back by the tick.
- **Bots** are Hollow.Client with scripted input. Tests run the server and bots headless.

### 4.4 Network

- LiteNetLib over UDP. Reliable ordered channel: commands, intents, static entities, container contents.
  Unreliable sequenced channel: inputs and snapshots.
- Messages are typed structs, bit-packed by generated code: no reflection or JSON on hot paths.
- Snapshots go out 20 times a second, delta-compressed against the last one the client acknowledged, for the
  entities its relevance grid selects, within a bandwidth budget (≤ 256 kbit/s in a fight).
- Shots: projectiles with drop and travel time are simulated on the server. Hit tests rewind targets to what the
  shooter saw, using one second of hitbox history. Clients never report hits.
- For testing, the transport can add latency, jitter and packet loss, and the client shows a network graph.

### 4.5 Physics and movement

- **Jolt** through JoltPhysicsSharp, on the server and in the client's prediction. A G1 spike confirms it runs in both
  processes; the fallback is BepuPhysics2 (pure C#).
- **Characters** use Jolt's virtual character. "Up" is away from the planet's centre, expressed in the zone's frame,
  so nothing assumes +Y is up. Walk, sprint, crouch, jump, swim, fall damage.
- **Collision:** terrain chunks are mesh shapes built from Hollow.Surface, identical on both sides. Building parts
  are boxes and convex hulls from data. Deployables and natural objects use simple shapes.
- Godot's own physics is used only for cosmetic things: ragdolls and debris.

### 4.6 Planet surface

- **A pure function** of (body, planet state, point on the sphere, surface generator version), built with `DMath`
  (ARCHITECTURE.md §8), so the server's collision and the client's terrain agree to the bit.
- **Cube-sphere:** six faces, quadtree tiles. Chunk meshes with levels of detail out to the horizon for drawing;
  collision only near players. A zone uses a tangent frame at its origin (ARCHITECTURE.md §6).
- **Height:** continents and oceans that match the ocean cover; mountain ranges and rifts from plate tectonics;
  hills, valleys, coasts and beaches.
- **Climate and biomes:** temperature from latitude, height, season and the planet state; moisture; a biome table
  that picks ground materials and plant sets.
- **Scatter:** trees, bushes, grass, rocks, ore nodes and plants per tile, deterministic. Their IDs are tile + index
  (ARCHITECTURE.md §7).
- **Sky:** scattering from the planet's own air; the real sun, the two white dwarfs, the moon and the other planets
  at their real positions for the universe time; the star field from the galaxy generator.
- **Water:** oceans and lakes, with shorelines.
- **The interface between the two G1 work packages** is `ISurface` in Hollow.Surface: height and normal at a point,
  biome at a point, collision chunk for a tile, scatter for a tile. The network work starts on a simple
  implementation of it and switches to the real one when it lands.

### 4.7 Persistence

SQLite through Hollow.Persistence, as in ARCHITECTURE.md §13:
- what's stored: characters, persistent entities grouped by region, overrides of natural objects, and zone
  metadata (`last_simulated_at`, versions);
- dirty entities are written every 30 s and on shutdown;
- deaths, trades and transfers commit at once.

### 4.8 Characters

What a player looks like to others and to themselves. Code in `game/scripts/Characters/`, assets in
`game/assets/characters/` and `game/assets/items/`, built from text by the Blender scripts in `art/` (§9).

**The contract.** `CharacterView` (a `Node3D`) draws one player from state alone. The network side feeds it; nothing in it
knows about the network.

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Apply(CharacterFrame)`, every frame | `Position` (feet) and `Up` (unit, away from the planet's centre), in the view's parent space; `Yaw` (radians about `Up`, 0 = north = the parent's −Z laid on the ground plane, anticlockwise seen from above: the movement code's view yaw); `Pitch` (view pitch, + up); `Velocity` (m/s); `Stance` (stand, crouch, swim); `Grounded`; `Held` (unarmed, tool, pistol, rifle) and `HeldItem` (the model, optional). |
| `Trigger(CharacterEvent, direction)` | `Swing` (tool strike or punch), `Fire`, `Reload`, `Hit` (a flinch), `Death` (ragdoll, pushed along `direction`). `Revive()` stands it up again. |
| `Wear(items)` | The worn clothing and armour: one item per wear slot (seven slots, §6: head, face, torso, torso armour, legs, hands, feet). |

`ViewmodelView` is the first-person counterpart, a child of the player's camera: `Hold(kind, item)`, `Wear(items)`,
`Apply(ViewmodelFrame)` every frame (velocity in the camera's frame, look rate, grounded, sprinting, crouching, aiming)
and `Trigger(Swing | Fire | Reload)`. Its `AimAmount` (0 at the hip, 1 aimed down the sights) lets the owner narrow
the camera's field of view.

"Up" is given per frame and nothing assumes +Y: the view builds its basis from `Up` and `Yaw`, and everything inside
works in the character's own frame. The ragdoll falls along −`Up` at the moment of death.

**Body.** A MakeHuman adult male (1.78 m, eyes at 1.67 m), MPFB's game-engine skeleton: 53 bones with UE-style names
(`pelvis`, `spine_01`…`spine_03`, `neck_01`, `head`, `clavicle_l`, `upperarm_l`, `lowerarm_l`, `hand_l`, three bones per
finger, `thigh_l`, `calf_l`, `foot_l`, `ball_l`). Rest pose: MakeHuman's A-pose. Levels of detail: about 18,000, 7,000
and 2,400 triangles for the body; eyes, brows, lashes and short hair (MakeHuman CC0 assets) drop out with distance.
Players start in plain underwear, which is part of the body (the pelvis region, smoothed and with its own fabric
surface), so nobody is ever without it.

**Clothing.** Every body face belongs to one of thirteen regions (face, scalp, neck, chest, belly, pelvis, upper arm,
forearm, hand, thigh, calf, ankle, foot). A garment lists the regions it covers completely; the body's triangles there
are collapsed in the vertex shader (`hidden_regions`, a per-instance bit mask), so skin never pokes through and costs no
fragments. Garments carry the same regions, so an inner garment hides its parts under an outer one (trousers tucked
into boots). Garments are single shells built from the body's own surface and skinned to the same skeleton.

**Animation.** One `AnimationTree` graph, shared by all characters (`CharacterAnimator`):
- speed blends for standing (idle, walk, jog, sprint at 0, 1.25, 2.8 and 5.5 m/s), crouching and swimming, kept in
  step with Godot's cyclic sync; each loop is stretched so its feet keep up with the ground at its speed;
- a fall pose blended in while airborne, a take-off and a landing played as one-shots;
- held-item layers: the right arm (tool, pistol, rifle) and the left arm with the chest (pistol, rifle);
- one-shot upper-body actions (tool swing, punch, throw, pistol fire and reload) and flinches.

The clips only run forward; `CharacterPoser`, a `SkeletonModifier3D`, turns the hips towards the direction of travel
and the chest back to the aim (running backwards plays the loop in reverse), spreads the view pitch over spine, neck and
head, reaches both hands onto a rifle's grips with two-bone IK, and plants the feet on uneven ground (the hips drop,
each leg reaches the ground found by a ray under its foot).

**First person.** The arms are the body's own mesh with only the arm regions drawn (and the worn sleeves), on render
layer 2, without shadows, with their own field of view (60°) and depth pulled towards the near plane so they never
clip into walls. Both hands reach the item's grips by IK and take finger poses from clip frames. The item moves
procedurally: sway, walk bob, sprint pose, swing arc, recoil kick on a spring, aiming down the sights (the sight on the
camera's centre line), reload (item tilts, the magazine drops out and back, the left hand follows it). Unarmed shows no
arms, as in Rust.

**Death.** `PhysicalBoneSimulator3D` with fourteen capsules (pelvis, two spine, head, upper and lower arms, thighs,
calves, feet), cones at the spine, shoulders and hips, hinges at the elbows and knees. Built on first use. Ragdolls
collide with the world (layer 1), not with each other; gravity is applied along −`Up`.

**Cost.** Mesh level by camera distance (to 9 m, 28 m, 450 m; nothing beyond). Animation runs every frame up close,
every second frame in the middle distance and every fourth far away, staggered across characters; the procedural layer
runs only where it can be seen, foot placement only at the nearest level.

**Viewer.** `--view character` (options in AGENTS.md): cycle outfits, held items and motions, fire every event, die and
revive, switch to first person, and measure a crowd.

## 5. Steps

Each step is multiplayer and playable. The owner playtests at the end of each one.

| Step | What you can play | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **G1 Foundation** | Two players and bots on the first world. Walk, sprint, crouch, jump, swim, fall damage. See each other move. Chat. Day and night. After a server restart you're where you left off. | Two Godot clients, the server and 100 bots run on this PC. Prediction feels instant at a simulated 150 ms ping. Tick time and bandwidth are measured. The owner approves the surface from screenshots. |
| **G2 Survive** | Gather wood, ore, fibre and pickups with tools (bonus for the weak spot). Inventory, hotbar, clothing. Crafting queue and workbench tiers. Furnace, campfire, boxes. Health, food, water, temperature, bleeding. Melee and bow. Death leaves a lootable body; respawn on the beach, at a bag or at a bed; logged-off players sleep in the world. | Two players can play the first hours of a Rust wipe together. |
| **G3 Build** | Foundations, walls, doorways, windows, floors, stairs and roofs, in five grades. Upgrade, rotate, demolish. Stability and collapse. Doors with key and code locks. The claim device: build rights, upkeep, decay. | A base survives a server restart. A big base streams in without a hitch. |
| **G4 Fight** | Guns with drop, recoil (the AK pattern), aiming down sights, attachments and ammo types. Damage by body part, armour, wounded state. | A fight between two players at a simulated 150 ms ping feels fair to both. |
| **G5 Raid** | Explosives, damage by grade and weak side, raid alerts, offline raids. | A base can be raided while its owner is offline, and the owner is alerted. |
| **G6 Ship** | The vehicle workbench crafts the Tin Finch. Board it through its hatch; first-person cockpit; take off, fly and land anywhere on the first world, and climb to orbit. Other players see it fly. | Two players can fly one to the other side of the planet and land beside a base. |
| **G7 World** | Animals, monuments with loot, guards and radiation, barrels, a recycler, a currency and a tech tree, teams, the map. | |
| **G8 More worlds** | The same game on any landable body; several zones per planet that merge and split (ARCHITECTURE.md §10.1). The ship reaches the moon and the other planets (supercruise, M5). | |

Later: electricity and turrets, farming, traps, miners (our own feature), ground vehicles. Ships (M5) cover what
Rust's helicopters do.

## 6. Gameplay rules and their numbers

The rules follow Rust. The numbers live in `game/data/ground/` (ARCHITECTURE.md P8), with a note on each table
saying where it came from. Sources, in order of preference:

1. RustMVP's legacy specs: `docs/architecture/legacy/building_damage.md`, `inventory_survival.md`,
   `weapons_character_ui.md` (in `D:\GameDev\Projects\RustMVP`).
2. RustMVP's rule headers `unreal/Bare/Source/Bare/Rules/*.hpp`, including the AK recoil pattern in
   `weapon_definition.hpp`.
3. hollow-orbit's tables (`js/game/items.js`), building rules (`briefs/building.md`) and system contracts
   (`GAME_API.md`), in `D:\GameDev\Projects\hollow-orbit-source\hollow-orbit`.

| Area | Rules |
|---|---|
| Survival | Health, calories, hydration, temperature (planet climate, clothing, fires), bleeding, later radiation and comfort. |
| Gathering | Trees, ore nodes, plants, pickups, animal corpses. Yield grows with the tool; the weak spot gives a bonus. Nodes have depletion stages and respawn. |
| Inventory | 24 main slots, 6 belt, 7 wear. Stacks, splitting, quick move, drag and drop, loot panels. |
| Crafting | Queue with times, ingredients taken up front and refunded on cancel. Workbench tiers 1–3. Blueprints and tech tree in G6. |
| Building | 3 m module and storey. Square and triangle foundations, walls, doorways, windows, frames, floors, stairs, roofs, half and low walls. Five grades. Sockets and snapping, placement checks, stability, upgrade, rotate and demolish within a time window, repair. |
| Claims | The claim device (our tool cupboard): authorised players, build rights in an area, upkeep storage, decay when unpaid. |
| Doors | Wooden, metal and armoured, single and double, garage door. Key locks and code locks. |
| Combat | Melee, bows, firearms. Ballistic projectiles, recoil patterns, spread, aiming down sights, attachments, ammo types, body-part multipliers, armour. |
| Death | Wounded state, lootable body, respawn on the beach, at a sleeping bag or bed (each with a cooldown), sleepers. |
| Raiding | Explosives and explosive ammo, damage per grade, weak sides, raid alerts. |

---

## 7. Data

`game/data/ground/*.json`, read by the server and the client:
- items, recipes and categories;
- building parts, grades, costs and upkeep;
- deployables, loot tables, gather yields;
- weapons, ammo and recoil patterns;
- damage and protection tables, survival constants.

A test checks that every reference resolves and that every recipe can be made from gatherable resources.

---

## 8. Interface

The RustMVP interface is the reference, matched exactly: layout, colours, fonts, spacing, behaviour.

| Screen | Reference (in `D:\GameDev\Projects\RustMVP`) |
|---|---|
| HUD, hotbar, vitals | `docs/evidence/ui-restoration-2026-10-01/hud-final.png`, `logs/ui-polish/hud.png` |
| Inventory | `docs/evidence/ui-restoration-2026-10-01/inventory-final.png`, `logs/ui-reference-final/inventory.png` |
| Crafting | `logs/ui-reference-final/crafting.png` |
| Building and hammer wheels | `docs/evidence/building-2026-10-04/plan-wheel-build4-image-1.png`, `hammer-wheel-build4-image-1.png` |
| Specification | `docs/architecture/legacy/weapons_character_ui.md` |

- **Fonts:** Barlow and Barlow Condensed (SIL OFL 1.1), as in RustMVP (`assets/SourceUI/fonts`).
- **Built with `Ui`:** every length through `Ui.Px`, no stretch mode (AGENTS.md).
- **Icons** are rendered from our own models.
- **The character on the inventory screen is ours.** The reference image shows RustMVP's extracted body, which is
  never used (§9).

---

## 9. Assets

**Allowed sources:**
- Our own Blender scripts. Blender 5.2.1 is at `D:\GameDev\Tools\blender-5.2.1-windows-x64`.
- The PSG kits in `D:\GameDev\Assets`. They were built by Blender Python with Poly Haven CC0 textures:
  - `PSG_BuildingKit_R01`: 13 parts × 5 grades.
  - `PSG_DoorWindowKit_R01`: the source files; R02 is Unreal-only.
  - `PSG_ResourceNodes_R01`: 4 ore nodes × 3 depletion stages, and miner deposits.
  - `PSG_StarterKit_R02`: workbenches, boxes, tools, two guns, the cupboard, a bag and a code lock.
  - `PSG_C4VFX_R01`: explosion flipbooks.
  - Also `RustMVP/assets/PSG_FrontierAK_R05`, `Assets/ResourceNodes` and `TinFinch_TF01`.

  Rename their Rust item names, and redo any shape that copies a Rust model too closely: the ore-node notes call
  them "reconstructions".
- The texture and plant sets in `D:\GameDev\Assets`:
  - Poly Haven: CC0.
  - Megascans and other Fab content: check the licence of each item; some Fab content is Unreal-only.
  - LOLIPOP trees: CC BY 4.0, credit required.
- Downloads the owner approved on 12 October 2026 (§1), kept outside the repository in
  `D:\GameDev\Assets\Downloads\<name>\` and listed with their checksums in `game/assets/THIRD_PARTY.md`:
  - Quaternius Universal Animation Library 1 and 2, Standard (CC0);
  - MPFB 2.0.17, MakeHuman for Blender (GPL code; the base mesh, targets, rigs and weights it uses are CC0);
  - the MakeHuman system asset pack (CC0): the skin, eyes, eyebrows, eyelashes and hair of the player body.
- Other CC0 or CC-BY sources (CMU motion capture, Poly Haven, Kenney) if a need arises.

**Never used** (extracted from Rust's game files):
- RustMVP's player body and first-person arms (`Content/Rust/Character`).
- Every animation derived from Rust (`Saved/RustReference`).
- The BareRustWorld maps and their cliffs, rocks, water and ice.
- The gas station monument: `Assets/Oxum-Test`, `RustMVP/assets/SourceMonuments/oxum`, and `client/world/monuments/oxum`
  in RustMVP's git history.
- `Assets/RustMapsResearch`.

**Pipeline:**
- **Models:** Blender Python scripts in the repository export GLB into `game/assets/`.
- **Characters** (§4.8): scripts in `art/`, run in background Blender (AGENTS.md has the commands), in this order:
  1. `art/characters/build_body.py`: the MakeHuman body through MPFB (installed in a separate Blender user folder,
     `BLENDER_USER_RESOURCES`), regions, underwear, levels of detail → `human_male.glb`, `human_male.json`, textures;
     also `art/.cache/human_male.blend` (not committed) for the next scripts.
  2. `art/characters/build_clothing.py`: the garments, shaped from the body and skinned to it → `clothing.glb`,
     `clothing.json` (materials), textures.
  3. `art/characters/build_animations.py`: retargets the UAL clips → `animations.glb`, `animations.json`.
  4. `art/items/build_items.py`: the held items from the PSG kits, renamed, with grip and sight sockets →
     `game/assets/items/<id>.glb`.
  5. `python -I art/lib/import_settings.py` after Godot first sees new files: compressed textures with mipmaps, no
     automatic LODs (the scripts make their own), constant animation tracks kept.
- **Kit FBX files:** centimetres (scale 0.01); `UCX_` collision renamed to Godot's `-col` / `-convcolonly`; use the
  OpenGL normal maps, or flip the green channel of the DirectX ones.
- **Textures:** 2K by default. The PC has 8 GB of video memory and 16 GB of RAM, and RustMVP ran out of memory on
  bulk loads.
- **Credits:** every third-party file is listed in `game/assets/THIRD_PARTY.md` with its source and licence.

---

## 10. How the work is run

- **Branches:**
  - The `ground` branch lives in `D:\GameDev\Projects\Hollow-wt\ground` and starts from `generator-v2` for the
    planet state.
  - Work packages run on their own branches and worktrees and merge into `ground`.
  - Nothing merges into `main` without the owner.
- **G1 runs as two packages in parallel:** network core (`ground-net`) and planet surface (`ground-planet`). They
  meet at `ISurface` (§4.6).
- **Every package:**
  - docs first;
  - build and tests green;
  - one scripted run and one screenshot per view;
  - a commit after each green step.

---

## 11. Open questions

1. **Day length:** compressed ×24 is the working default (§1). The owner may switch it back to real rotation.
2. **Character decisions taken by Claude while the owner is away** (§4.8; the owner may change any of them):
   - The UAL clips are retargeted onto MakeHuman's game-engine skeleton, not the other way round: the body keeps its
     A-pose bind (better shoulders) and the two skeletons already share bone names.
   - The first headwear is a knit cap rather than a hood: a hood needs cloth folds around the face that a scripted
     shell does not give yet.
   - The seven wear slots are head, face, torso, torso armour, legs, hands and feet.
   - Underwear is part of the body and cannot be taken off, as in Rust.
   - In third person a rifle is carried at the right shoulder, pointing where the player looks; with nothing in hand
     the first-person view shows no arms, as in Rust.
   - Item names: flint axe, flint pick, hand stone, Wren pistol, Kestrel rifle; knit cap, woven shirt, woven
     trousers, laced boots, riveted breastplate.
3. **Tech ladder:** Rust's is assumed.
